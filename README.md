# Semantha VideoSearch
## Description
The Semantha Video Search is a tool for semantically searching through videos. <br>
It's a web app that allows you to search for a word or phrase and get back a list of timestamped video clips matching the query. <br>

## Creating new demos
The main branch is meant to be a template to build on. <br>
The concrete demos are in separate branches:

  * Harman AI: Search through [IBM Engineering Lifecycle Management](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL5VAskozuQ3DzALoCAFRXbfTy7VmSLm5D)
  * BOSCH: Work in progress

To transcribe new playlists checkout [video_transcription/README.md].
To configure the search engine modify video_search/configuration/demo_config.py.
